        "The weapons made in the <SHOP> are known all throughout <TOWN> for their durability. The secret? <OWNER> doesn't uses regular metals. Instead, the weapons are made with an alloy that contains the remains of a Magma Mephit. This prevents the weapons from breaking, but also appears to prevent corrosion.",
        "Although the tools made in the <SHOP> are made very well, it is known that not many purchase anything that isn't overpriced. The owner of the shop, <OWNER>, is known for being a great salesman, and regularly manages to sell items for a higher price than that they are worth.",
        "The <SHOP> is a new store that had opened just recently. When <OWNER> moved to <TOWN> only a handful of days ago, they decided it would be best to earn their money by selling weapons and tools.",
        "The <SHOP> is known for being involved with business from the underground. You'll often spot shady customers buying goods for suspicious reasons here. The owner of the shop, <OWNER>, does not feel the need to have conversations with their customers either. You simply get what you want, and then you leave the store.",
        "The citizens of <TOWN> tell rumors about how lots of people had strange accidents when they worked with tools from the <SHOP>.",
        "This small establishment seems to have passed through some rough times. The owner will make whatever they can to make you come back!",
        "<SHOP> is well run and regularly shopped at by the denizens of <TOWN>. <OWNER> adds lots of small decorations like spikes and rivets to the armor that many of the townspeople believe enhances the quality, but to a trained eye these are purely aesthetic and serve no protective function.",
        "<SHOP> is a recently opened shop manned by <OWNER>, who has been known to complain and sob loudly to anybody in earshot about how much they dislike being a blacksmith. They lament to an unruly degree, claiming to truly desire to be a painter. They claim that no-one in <TOWN> would buy their artwork and is left to do the borish work of a blacksmith instead. The walls of <SHOP> are covered in truly terrible paintings at incredibly high costs.</p><p style=\"width: 50%;\"><TOWN> has an active interest in keeping <OWNER> as a smith as his metalwork is truly a work of art.",
        "Strangely enough, <SHOP> has a trained rust monster as a pet around the shop. The monster is mischievous but appears to be so well trained that it will leave customers' equipment alone. While it can sometimes cause light corroding to merchandise, <OWNER> finds this adorable. They always check for damage to an item before selling and will always have a replacement ready on hand.  </p><p style=\"width: 50%;\"><OWNER> is generally sentimental to adventurers who have lost equipment to wild rust monsters and will normally sell them replacements at a large discount. They will also happily purchase any damaged or broken equipment at a fair price to give to their pet as feed. ",

        "Not many who live in <TOWN> would visit the <SHOP> for their pleasure. The owner of the shop is known for acting in a strange manner that people do not trust.",
        "Careful when you choose to enter this store: the owner seems to prefer to deal with people of their same race. Other races will get a slightly worse deal, or even get scammed!",
        "The <SHOP> is a very calm store with few customers. Secretly, it is a hiding place for wanted criminals. <OWNER> keeps all the wanted criminals in a hidden basement and uses all the earned money to buy food for the criminals. Not many people in <TOWN> know about <OWNER>'s secret.\nAll items that <SHOP> sells are overpriced and <OWNER> wil desperately sell as much as possible for as much gold as possible, in order to be able to afford for all the food.",
        "In the basement of the <SHOP>, there is an entrance to <TOWN>'s sewers that hardly anyone knows about. The owner, <OWNER>, uses this entrance to feed the creatures that live below, making the creatures so big and ferocious that the sewers have become a dangerous place to enter.",

        "<SHOP> has served <TOWN> faithfully for several years, selling an assortment of fairly priced essentials. However, <OWNER> has been known for their eccentric collection of ropes, especially those made from strange and magical materials. Additionally, they have been known to aggressively attempt to sell ropes to anybody who shows interest while overwhelming them with highly specific rope facts. Most know it is a bad idea to bring up ropes around them.</p><p style=\"width: 50%;\">It is rumoured that <SHOP> has a secret backroom that is filled to the brim with rare rope spools of the highest quality.",
        "Known for having great prices and a wide selection, <SHOP> always seems to carry a distinct and odd smell that changes from day-to-day. <OWNER> seems oblivious to the smell and playfully disregards any attempts to inform them of it. </p><p style=\"width: 50%;\">Most residents of <TOWN> are aware of the smell and has become a regular talking point in the taverns at the end of the day.",
        "The door to this shop barely hangs onto its frame, and signifies the entrances with a strained groan. Holes worn through the outer walls allow shafts of light to gleam brilliantly through the freshly disturbed dust wafting through the air. They land on various places on the shelves, highlighting just what the next adventurer might need."

        "Besides being a shop, the <SHOP> is also known for the enthusiastic owner, <OWNER>, who entertains children on the street when no-one is looking for any goods to buy in their shop. The shop is filled with magical items and small trinkets that aren't always as useful, but are fun to play around with.",
        "The <SHOP> is a high-standard jewelry shop that excels in magical jewelry. While their prices are often immensely high, people come from far and wide to visit the store and to have a look at <OWNER>'s magical jewels.",
        "<SHOP> looks messy, to say the least. The owner is always working, reading, mumbling to themselves, pacing around the room dodging the piles of stuff they have. They won't realize they are being talked to. In fact, they will tell everybody off who dares interrupt their work. People in <TOWN> wonder how this shop owner actually makes a living...",
        "<OWNER>, the owner of <SHOP>, secretly finds most of the magic items by walking through forests and caves with their dog, who can smell magic. Unfortunately, the dog also smells mimics, and a third of the items sold are therefore baby mimics, biding their time.",
        "This store is run by a paranoid magician, who has done extensive research on magical warding. When customers enter, their hair momentarily stands on end and they hear a consistent dull noise as they come under the effect of the shop's wards. Sometimes, the owner casts identify on their customers' items without consent and magically evicts those found with overly powerful artifacts.</p><p>While no one is quite sure what these wards do, no spellcasting of any kind is permitted in the shop. However, those who have been caught braking this rule are rarely the same again.",

However, <TOWN> residents sometimes hear strange and muffled sounds coming from the shop at odd hours.</p><p style=\"width: 50%;\">In truth, <SHOP> has a secret basement prison filled with tortured monsters. Using strange and sadistic magical implements, <OWNER> extracts magical essences from these creatures to sell to the upper class in <TOWN> as luxury goods.",
        "A smell of sulfur and ozone accost your senses as you enter the shop, and you immediately notice the shop keep behind the counter digging through what seems like the aftermath of a failed experiment. Even surrounded by glorious jewelry, clothing, and numerous magical reagents, the mage seems overwhelmed in their task. It's not until you see what seems like a toy manticore come to life screeching at you from above the now closed doorway behind you that the mage even realizes your presence and begins to clean up the mess and address your needs.",
        "Each item you glance at seems to primp itself up in place. Whenever your gaze wanders over the shelves, you can swear that the wares are shuffling around to make themselves presentable. All remains still under direct observation, however. "
