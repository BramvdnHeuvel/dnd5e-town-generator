SECRET = "CHANGE-ME"
# Change the SECRET if you don't want your towns to be unique.
# This is useful for DMs, because your players can only view your generated towns
# if they know what the SECRET was that you used.
# (In other words, if no-one knows what SECRET you use, then  no-one can see your towns.)
#
# Examples of SECRET values are:
# SECRET = "f89wurniout8944ucuwioy98wevstuiu4soiytiue4ucuioshevui5fys"
# SECRET = "I-WISH-I-COULDVE-GOTTEN-WITH-RYAN-ON-THAT-COOL-RETREAT-JAN-HAS-PLASTIC-BOOBS-I-HAVE-HEMORRHOIDS"
# SECRET = "uds987rujkwreR#RWEtu8er9uoiwjlrrgERYRTttter34ure"

PREMIUM = False
# Set PREMIUM to False if:
#   - You don't want others to overload the program;
#   - You want to allow multiple users to use this program simultaneously;
#   - Your computer doesn't handle huge calculations well.
#
# Set PREMIUM to True if:
#   - You want to go wild with creating crazy town sizes;

ALLOW_ADS = False
# If you're not the original developer, you can ignore this value.
#
# If you set this boolean to True, ads may pop up on your webpage.
# As the developer, I wanted to put some ads on the website so I can pay
# for the server that is running this website. Setting this to True
# won't earn you any money - I'll be the one getting it.
